regexplain_addin()
}
\description{
Addin for regexplain. If the selection does not contain multiple lines, the
addin tries to evaluate the selection and coerce the result to a character
string. Only unique lines are passed to the gadget to maximize screen space.
The max number of lines returned is set by the option
\code{regexplain.addin.max_lines}, with a default value of 100 lines.
If evaluating the selection does not produce a character vector without
errors, the original selection is returned.
